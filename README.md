# Portfolio Website
This is a simple portfolio website showcasing my coding projects.

It was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript using Bootstrap. A key feature of this site is its simplicity: All 3 sections are seemlessly reached by scrolling or through the navigation bar. It also includes a hamburger menu for phones, making it easy to navigate on any device.
